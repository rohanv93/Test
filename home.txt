i know i am not good and i never wanna think about good and bad deeds it is just meaningless to me'
i am drunk right noe that might be the reason and courage i have right noew to express my feelings ,,,,,,
in the beginning i an confused about my life goals i dont wanna be 9  5 job moreover i dont wanna be a business induced stress ful life ,,, i wanna be a free sou;life i want wings to fly i want to go to sky i want to be dire like a legeng ..
 i dont want a death due to aging or death on bed that seems boring ,,,,,,what i want a death like exploring actually i dont want to be dead i want my soul be to be free and discover the secrets of the reality and world ...
  i want to go to space and discover the origin and purpose of lifre ,,,, we are not born to please other souls or this so called fake society as a human we want attention of others we want to be recognised but in reality we fed up pwith this 
  system ... it seems lke a complex mathematical evaluated expression to control human life through desire, purpose and what so called feed.
  this life wants to be different and so that called want to be recognised a special than other lifes 
  we are not special just because we are superior to others or just we can do the thing which are not able to done by others easily ..
   we want to have a fake feeling of speciality so we can just gignore the purposely facts of life and move forward..
